# Machine learning workshop @ TMA22 PhD School 

Jupyter Notebooks and supporting code for the machine learning workshop at the [TMA22 PhD School](https://tma.ifip.org/2022/phd-school/).

This workshops contains two assignments:

- [**Assignment1**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SIDN/tma22_ml/blob/main/Assignment1.ipynb): Participants use this notebook to train, test and tune [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) classifier(s) that discriminate between benign and fraud transactions.
- [**Assignment2**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/SIDN/tma22_ml/blob/main/Assignment2.ipynb): Participants use this notebook to inclemently improve their classifier(s) using active learning. 

## Run locally

We use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) during the workshop.
You can also run the notebooks locally by cloning this repository and setting up a Python environment yourself.

## Contact

The workshop was created by Thymen Wabeke and Thijs van den Hout. 
Please contact us via sidnlabs@sidn.nl if you have a question. 

## Credits

The workshop is centered around the 'Credit Card Fraud Detection' dataset by ULB's Machine Learning Group and was [originally published on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).

Some supporting code on active learning was inspired by Google's [Active Learning Playground](https://github.com/google/active-learning) and the [modAL package](https://github.com/modAL-python/modAL)A.
